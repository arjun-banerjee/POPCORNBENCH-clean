# Sweep runner

Run the multi-turn KernelBench agent across **multiple models × levels × problems**
in parallel, with per-model rate limiting, GPU oversubscription, per-GPU
perf-timing locks, and a live self-refreshing HTML report.

## TLDR

```bash
# 1. Drop API keys in .env (TEJAS_AZURE_KEY, THAVA_AZURE_KEY, POPCORN_AZURE_KEY, XAI_API_KEY for Grok, etc.).
# 2. Edit configs/sweep.example.toml to taste.
# 3. Run.
uv run python scripts/run_sweep.py configs/sweep.example.toml

# Live report:  http://<host>:8765/index.html
# (from your laptop:  ssh -L 8765:localhost:8765 user@host  →  http://localhost:8765)
```

## Quick correctness test (a few problems on level 1)

Pin `problem_subset` to a short list and drop everything else to a single
model with shallow agent caps. This is the fastest way to check that an
endpoint, key, and the eval loop all wire up before you commit a real run.

```toml
# configs/sweep.smoke.toml
[run]
name              = "smoke_l1"
dataset_src       = "local"
variants          = ["original"]
levels            = [1]
problem_subset    = [1, 19, 23]      # Square_matmul, ReLU, Softmax
backend           = "cuda"
precision         = "fp32"
gpu_arch          = ["Hopper"]
timing_method     = "cuda_event"
num_correct_trials = 3               # quicker than the default 5
num_perf_trials   = 20               # quicker than the default 100

base_url    = "https://tejas-mohrgcfh-eastus2.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/v1/"
api_key_env = "TEJAS_AZURE_KEY"
rpm         = 250
tpm         = 250000
```

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_sweep.py configs/sweep.smoke.toml
```

After it finishes, the top of `report/index.html` shows the correct/compiled
counts; click into the variant card → into the model card → into any single
problem to see the conversation, the kernel that was submitted, and the
correctness verdict.

## How parallelism is laid out

```
work matrix    = (model × level × problem_id)
process pool   = num_gpu_devices * agents_per_gpu workers
each worker    = bound to one GPU via CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
per model      = mp.Manager().Semaphore  (caps in-flight LLM calls)
per GPU        = mp.Manager().Lock       (serializes submit_kernel timing)
```

Why oversubscribe? Each agent turn is dominated by LLM wait (seconds to a
minute). The GPU sits idle 80–90% of the time, so 3–4 agents per H100 keep both
budgets busy. The per-GPU lock around `submit_kernel.execute` ensures perf
timings are never collected concurrently on the same device, so wall-clock
numbers stay clean even under oversubscription.

Per-model concurrency defaults to roughly `tpm / 25_000` (≈10k tokens/turn × 2.5×
safety). Override with `max_concurrency = N` on any `[[models]]` block once you
have real token usage numbers.

## API kinds

| `api_kind`    | Endpoint shape       | Used for                                                |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `openai`      | Responses API        | gpt-5.x (supports `reasoning_effort`)                    |
| `openai_chat` | Chat Completions     | FW-GLM-5-1, Llama-Maverick, Kimi-K2.x, **xAI Grok**, generic OpenAI-compatible servers |

The two paths share tools, prompts, and trajectory format — only the wire
protocol differs. Models that emit a Chat-Completions `reasoning_content`
field have it captured in the trajectory but not resent to the model on the
next turn (Chat Completions doesn't require it).

## Endpoints (Azure-specific)

The five models we sweep sit on three different Azure surfaces. The base URLs
were verified end-to-end by `scripts/probe_endpoints.py` (one trivial request
per model) — re-run that script if you suspect an outage or rotated key.

### Azure OpenAI v1 preview, OpenAI-branded models (`tejas-…cognitiveservices.azure.com`)

The OpenAI-branded models (gpt-5.x) live here. The OpenAI Python SDK auto-
appends `/responses` or `/chat/completions` to the v1 base, so one URL covers
both `api_kind`s. **No `api-version` query string required.**

```toml
base_url = "https://tejas-mohrgcfh-eastus2.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/v1/"
api_kind = "openai"          # gpt-5.x supports the Responses API
```

### Azure OpenAI v1 preview, Foundry-hosted partner models (`popcorn-foundry-resource.openai.azure.com`)

Third-party models that are deployed *through* Azure OpenAI Service (currently
GLM-5 family) sit on a `…openai.azure.com/openai/v1/` base. Same SDK auto-
routing as above, but only Chat Completions is supported (not Responses).

```toml
base_url = "https://popcorn-foundry-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/"
api_kind = "openai_chat"
```

### Azure AI Inference / Foundry (`thava-…services.ai.azure.com`)

Llama-Maverick and Kimi-K2.6 are deployed on Azure AI Inference (not Azure
OpenAI). The SDK base is `/models`; only Chat Completions is supported here,
never the Responses API.

```toml
base_url = "https://thava-openai.services.ai.azure.com/models"
api_kind = "openai_chat"
```

### xAI Grok (`https://api.x.ai/v1`)

[Grok](https://x.ai/) uses the **OpenAI Python SDK** with `base_url =
"https://api.x.ai/v1"`. For **KernelBench’s multi-turn tool agent**, use **`api_kind
= "openai_chat"`** (Chat Completions).

**Do not use `api_kind = "openai"` (Responses)** for Grok in this harness: after
the first turn the agent resends OpenAI Responses-shaped **`input`** items
(`function_call_output`, `reasoning`, …). xAI’s Responses server deserializes
that payload with a stricter `ModelInput` type and returns **422 /
UnprocessableEntityError** (`data did not match any variant of untagged enum
ModelInput`). Chat Completions uses ordinary `messages` (`system` / `user` /
`assistant` / `tool`), which Grok accepts.

Docs: [xAI — chat](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/chat); reference hub: [Grok API (Apidog)](https://grok-api.apidog.io/).

Create an API key in the [xAI console](https://console.x.ai) and export it:

```bash
export XAI_API_KEY="xai-..."
```

Minimal checked-in sweep: **`configs/sweep.grok.toml`**. Typical knobs: **`request_timeout_s`** (e.g. `3600`), **`deployment_name`** if the wire model id differs from `name`.

If you only want to ping the endpoint:

```bash
# optional: export XAI_MODEL=grok-4.3   # default if unset
uv run python scripts/probe_endpoints.py --xai-only
```

### Verified working today

| Model                                    | base_url                                          | api_kind     |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|

| Grok (e.g. `grok-4.3`)                   | `https://api.x.ai/v1`                             | `openai_chat` |

### Quirks worth knowing

- **gpt-5.4-pro rejects `reasoning.effort = "low"`.** That deployment only
  accepts `"medium"` or `"high"` on the Responses API; passing `"low"`
  returns a 400 `Unsupported value`. Either set `[agent].reasoning_effort =
  "medium"` globally or override per-model on the gpt-5.4-pro `[[models]]`
  entry. (gpt-5.5 accepts the full range.)
- **Some Azure deployments reject `tools=` entirely.** DeepSeek-R1 on the
  Foundry `…services.ai.azure.com/models` surface returned a 400
  `UnsupportedToolUse` for any tool-enabled call — that deployment can't run
  the agent at all (the agent always sends `submit_kernel`). Re-run
  `probe_endpoints.py` before adding any new model; the `with tools` probe
  is what surfaces this.
- **Reasoning-content shape varies.** Some models emit reasoning via the
  Chat-Completions `reasoning_content` field; others (e.g. R1-style models)
  emit `<think>...</think>` blocks *inside* the assistant `content`. Both are
  captured in the trajectory; the HTML report's dedicated "reasoning"
  expander only renders the former.
- **`reasoning_effort` is silently ignored** when `api_kind = "openai_chat"`.
  Chat Completions has no `reasoning.effort` field. Set it on the gpt-5.x
  entries only.
- **xAI Grok** — use `api_kind = "openai_chat"` with `base_url =
  "https://api.x.ai/v1"` and `api_key_env = "XAI_API_KEY"`. Using `api_kind =
  "openai"` hits Responses with multi-turn tool payloads OpenAI’s SDK emits;
  xAI often returns **422 ModelInput** deserialization errors. See
  `configs/sweep.grok.toml` and `uv run python scripts/probe_endpoints.py --xai-only`.
- **Rotate any key that lands in the working tree.** `tmp.py` and similar
  scratch files are not committed but they're on disk; treat any key inside
  them as compromised.

## Output layout

```
runs/{run_name}/
    sweep_config.json                            -- snapshot of the TOML at run start
    {variant}/{model_name}/
        level_{L}_problem_{P}_trajectory.json
        level_{L}_problem_{P}_kernel.py          -- final submitted kernel (if any)
        level_{L}_problem_{P}_cache/             -- compile cache
    report/
        style.css
        index.html                               -- all-variants overview (one card per variant)
        v/{variant}/index.html                   -- per-variant summary + per-model rollup
        v/{variant}/models/{model}.html          -- grid of cards for one (variant, model)
        v/{variant}/t/{model}__l{L}_p{P}.html    -- TLDR + full conversation
```

When you sweep multiple variants (e.g. `variants = ["original", "popcorn"]`),
the top-level `index.html` shows one card per variant with rollup stats; click
a card to drop into that variant's subreport. This makes the original-vs-popcorn
comparison the first thing you see.

The runner is **resumable**: if a trajectory JSON already exists at the
expected path, that work item is skipped and its summary is folded into the
report directly.

## Viewing the report from a laptop

The runner spawns a small `http.server` on the configured port (default 8765).

```bash
# On your laptop:
ssh -L 8765:localhost:8765 you@your-h100-box
# Then in a browser:
open http://localhost:8765/index.html
```

If `serve_host = "0.0.0.0"` and the box is reachable, you can also hit it
directly. Pages auto-refresh every 60s; the underlying HTML is regenerated
every `refresh_seconds` (30s default).

## Sweep results & evaluation metrics

Every finished work item produces a `final_result` (a serialized
`KernelExecResult`) inside its trajectory JSON. The HTML report aggregates
these into per-variant and per-model rollups, and surfaces the per-problem
detail on the trajectory page.

### Top-line / rollup metrics (shown on the index pages)

| Metric              | Where it comes from                                    | Meaning |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| **trajectories**    | count of trajectory files                              | Total work items resolved (finished or skipped). |
| **finished**        | `finished_at` is set                                   | Items the agent actually completed (not in-progress). |
| **correct**         | `outcome == "correct"`                                 | `submit_kernel` reported numerically equivalent output. |
| **compiled**        | `final_result.compiled`                                | Kernel built — independent of correctness. |
| **avg speedup**     | mean of `ref_runtime / runtime` over correct items     | How much faster the kernel is than the PyTorch reference. |
| **outcome**         | `correct` \| `incorrect` \| `compile_fail` \| `error` \| `skipped` \| `in_progress` | Categorical end-state. |

### Per-problem extended metrics (shown on the trajectory page)

Populated by `submit_kernel` when `measure_performance=True`. Defined in
`src/kernelbench/extended_metrics.py` and stored on `KernelExecResult`:

| Field                    | Source                                  | What it captures |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|
| `runtime` / `ref_runtime`| `cuda_event` / `do_bench` / `host_time` | Wall-clock μs for the candidate and PyTorch reference. |
| `runtime_stats`          | `kernelbench.timing`                    | `mean`, `median`, `std`, `min`, `max` over `num_perf_trials`. |
| `numerical_precision`    | `eval_kernel_against_ref`               | `max_abs_error`, `mean_abs_error`, `max_rel_error`, `mean_rel_error` vs reference. |
| `memory_stats`           | `extended_metrics.measure_memory`       | `peak_memory_mb`, `ref_peak_memory_mb`, `memory_ratio`. |
| `kernel_launch_stats`    | `torch.profiler`                        | `num_kernels`, `ref_num_kernels`, `fusion_ratio` (= `ref_num_kernels / num_kernels`), top-10 kernel breakdown, total CUDA time. |
| `energy_stats`           | NVML (`pynvml`)                         | `energy_per_run_mj`, `ref_energy_per_run_mj`, `energy_ratio`, `avg_power_w`, `ref_avg_power_w`. Reports `-1` if `pynvml` not installed. |
| `sol_stats`              | Nsight (preferred) or speedup heuristic | `sol_score` ∈ [0, 1] = `max(dram_util, compute_util) / 100` from hardware counters; falls back to `min(speedup / 10, 1)` heuristic when ncu is unavailable. |
| `roofline_stats`         | Nsight (preferred) or device props      | DRAM bandwidth GB/s, FP32/FP16 TFLOPS, arithmetic intensity, ridge point, occupancy %, dominant pipe %, L1/L2 hit rates, coalescing (sectors/request), warp stall reasons, register/smem/block geometry, peak hardware specs. |
| `metadata.excessive_speedup` | `submit_kernel`                     | `True` when measured speedup tripped the anti-reward-hacking guard. |
| `source_runtime` / `speedup_vs_source` | translation mode             | When the candidate was translated from another DSL, the source-DSL implementation's timing and the candidate's speedup vs that source. |

Energy, SOL, and roofline metrics degrade gracefully: when NVML or Nsight is
unavailable the corresponding fields report `-1` / `"heuristic"` source rather
than blocking the eval.

## Reading a trajectory

Each trajectory page has:

- **TLDR card** at top: outcome badge, runtime, ref runtime, speedup, and
  inline compile/correctness errors when present.
- **Per-turn sections** below: each turn shows its LLM latency, an expandable
  reasoning block (yellow border), assistant text, every `function_call` with
  truncated arguments, and every tool result. Failed tool calls are
  expanded by default; everything else is collapsed.

## Tools the agent uses

Resolved by the `tools` key in `[run]`:

- `"default"` — every tool in the registry **except** the opt-in tools that
  require special hardware/software: `profile_kernel`, `disassemble_kernel`,
  `ert_roofline`.
- `"all"` — every tool in the registry, including the opt-in ones.
- `"compile_kernel,run_correctness,submit_kernel"` — explicit comma list.

`submit_kernel` is always added regardless; without it the agent has no way to
finalize a run.

### Full tool catalogue

The complete set of tools registered in `src/kernelbench/agent/tools.py`. Every
tool returns a one-line `{ToolName} {PASSED|FAILED}: {summary}` plus an
optional detail block (the two reference-data tools — `get_gpu_specs` and
`static_check` — are documented exceptions to the strict PASS/FAIL rule).

| Tool                  | In `default`? | Inputs        | What it does |
|-----------------------|:-------------:|---------------|--------------|
| `compile_kernel`      | yes           | `kernel_code` | Build the kernel only — surfaces nvcc/linker/syntax errors cheaply, no GPU run. |
| `run_correctness`     | yes           | `kernel_code` | Run `num_correct_trials` correctness checks against the PyTorch reference; reports per-trial pass/fail and numerical-precision stats (max/mean abs+rel error). No timing. |
| `get_gpu_specs`       | yes           | none          | Return peak hardware specs for the current GPU (memory bandwidth, TFLOPS per precision, SM count, smem per SM, registers). Reference data only. |
| `static_check`        | yes           | `kernel_code` | Static-analysis pass for reward-hacking patterns (try/except fallback to reference, timing-function patches, lazy-tensor tricks, threading injection). PASSED / PASSED-with-warnings / FAILED. |
| `submit_kernel`       | yes (always)  | `kernel_code` | Final eval: `num_correct_trials` correctness + `num_perf_trials` timing. Reports kernel runtime in μs **plus all extended metrics** (numerical precision, peak memory + ratio, kernel-launch count + fusion ratio, energy/run + ratio, SOL score). Reference runtime and speedup are intentionally hidden. Also flags excessive speedup. |
| `profile_kernel`      | opt-in        | `kernel_code` | Nsight Compute roofline profiling. Returns DRAM bandwidth utilization, FP32/FP16/tensor-core throughput, per-kernel breakdown, warp stall reasons, coalescing quality, L1/L2 hit rates, occupancy with limiting factors, pipe utilization, branch divergence, and targeted optimization hints. Supports delta comparison across calls. **Requires `nsight-python` + `ncu` in PATH.** |
| `disassemble_kernel`  | opt-in        | `kernel_code` | Disassemble the compiled CUDA binary to inspect SASS, PTX, register usage, instruction mix (memory vs compute vs control), tensor-core usage, and register spills. **Requires `cuobjdump` + `nvdisasm` (CUDA Toolkit).** |
| `ert_roofline`        | opt-in        | none          | Empirical Roofline Tool — micro-benchmarks measured peak bandwidth at each memory tier (L1, L2, DRAM/HBM) and peak FP32/FP16 TFLOPS for the current GPU. Computes the ridge point. Results are cached per GPU after first call. |

Notes:

- The agent's `tools` filter is applied case-sensitively against these exact
  names. Unknown names are silently dropped from the wanted set.
- All `kernel_code` arguments must be a complete Python module that defines a
  `ModelNew` class — not raw CUDA C/C++.
- `profile_kernel` runs in a subprocess (`scripts/_profile_worker.py`) because
  ncu relaunches the application — this is why oversubscribing agents per GPU
  is fine but the per-GPU `perf_lock_per_gpu` lock is important to keep timing
  measurements clean.

| `variants`           | list of strings  | `["original"]`                         | Sweep axis. Each entry is a subdirectory under `KernelBench/level{N}/`. Common values: `"original"` (100 upstream problems) and `"popcorn"` (curated set). Local only. |
| `variant`            | string           | —                                      | Legacy single-variant form. Equivalent to `variants = [variant]`. |
| `levels`             | list of ints     | **req**                                | E.g. `[1]`, `[1, 2]`, or `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. |
| `problem_subset`     | list of ints     | `[]`                                   | **Empty list runs every problem in the level.** Pass IDs to limit, e.g. `[1, 19, 23]`. The same subset filter is applied to every (level, variant) combination — IDs that don't exist in a given variant are silently dropped. |
| `backend`            | string           | `"cuda"`                               | `"cuda"` \| `"triton"` \| `"hip"` \| `"tilelang"` \| `"thunderkittens"` \| `"cute"`. |
| `precision`          | string           | `"fp32"`                               | `"fp32"` \| `"fp16"` \| `"bf16"`. Auto-overridden to `fp16` for tilelang and `bf16` for thunderkittens. |
| `gpu_arch`           | list of strings  | `["Hopper"]`                           | Passed to `set_gpu_arch()`. For H100 use `["Hopper"]`; for A100 `["Ampere"]`. |
| `timing_method`      | string           | `"cuda_event"`                         | `"cuda_event"` \| `"do_bench"` \| `"host_time"`. |
| `num_correct_trials` | int              | `5`                                    | Correctness trials run by `run_correctness` and inside `submit_kernel`. |
| `num_perf_trials`    | int              | `100`                                  | Timing trials inside `submit_kernel`. Drop to ~20 for smoke tests. |
| `tools`              | string           | `"default"`                            | `"default"` (everything except the opt-in tools `profile_kernel`, `disassemble_kernel`, `ert_roofline`), `"all"`, or a comma list like `"compile_kernel,run_correctness,submit_kernel"`. `submit_kernel` is always included regardless. See **Full tool catalogue** above. |

#### How to specify problems

```toml
problem_subset = []                 # all problems in each level
problem_subset = [1, 19, 23]        # exactly these IDs
problem_subset = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]    # IDs 1-5
```

The matrix that gets executed is `models × variants × levels × problem_subset`,
so `levels = [1, 2]` plus `problem_subset = [1, 19]` runs problems 1 and 19 on
both levels (4 problems × n_models). To target *only* a specific level, use a
single-element `levels` list and put your IDs in `problem_subset`.

Problem IDs come from the filename prefix. To find an ID, look at the file
listing under `KernelBench/level1/original/`:

```bash
ls KernelBench/level1/original | head -5
# 1_Square_matrix_multiplication_.py     -> ID 1
# 10_3D_tensor_matrix_multiplication.py  -> ID 10
# 19_ReLU.py                             -> ID 19
```

### `[agent]` — agent loop caps

| Key                    | Type   | Default | Notes |
|------------------------|--------|---------|-------|
| `max_turns`            | int    | `10`    | Hard cap on LLM turns per problem. Each turn = one `responses.create` (or `chat.completions.create`) call plus its tool dispatches. |
| `max_tool_calls`       | int    | `30`    | Hard cap on total tool calls across all turns of one problem. |
| `warn_turns_remaining` | int    | `2`     | Inject a "you are running out of turns" notice this many turns before exhaustion. |
| `turn_delay_s`         | float  | `0.0`   | Sleep between turns. Usually leave at 0; the per-model semaphore already paces. |
| `reasoning_effort`     | string | unset   | `"minimal"` \| `"low"` \| `"medium"` \| `"high"`. Sent as `reasoning.effort` on the Responses API. Ignored for `api_kind = "openai_chat"`. Models can override per-entry (see `[[models]]`). |

### `[parallelism]` — process pool layout

| Key                 | Type | Default | Notes |
|---------------------|------|---------|-------|
| `num_gpu_devices`   | int  | `1`     | Real CUDA devices available. Each worker is pinned to one via `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. |
| `agents_per_gpu`    | int  | `1`     | Oversubscription factor. Total worker count = `num_gpu_devices × agents_per_gpu`. Set to 3–4 on H100s — agent turns are LLM-bound, so each GPU sits idle most of the time. |
| `perf_lock_per_gpu` | bool | `true`  | If true, every `submit_kernel` call on a given device serializes via a per-GPU `mp.Lock`, so wall-clock timing is never measured concurrently with another agent's compile. Set to `false` only if you don't care about timing noise. |

### `[report]` — HTML report + live server

| Key               | Type   | Default     | Notes |
|-------------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| `enabled`         | bool   | `true`      | If false, no HTML is generated at all. |
| `refresh_seconds` | int    | `30`        | Background thread regenerates the report this often while a sweep runs. |
| `serve`           | bool   | `true`      | If true, also launch a small `http.server` thread serving `runs/{name}/report/`. |
| `serve_host`      | string | `"0.0.0.0"` | Bind address. Use `"127.0.0.1"` to keep it strictly local + SSH-forwarded. |
| `serve_port`      | int    | `8765`      | TCP port. Forward from your laptop with `ssh -L 8765:localhost:8765 user@host`. |

### `[[models]]` — one entry per model to sweep

This is a TOML array of tables — repeat the `[[models]]` block for each model
you want to run.

| Key                | Type   | Default                                                      | Notes |
|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `name`             | string | **req**                                                      | Display name. Also used as the directory under `runs/{name}/{variant}/{name}/`. |
| `api_kind`         | string | `"openai"`                                                   | `"openai"` for Responses API (gpt-5.x). Use `"openai_chat"` for Chat Completions (Grok, GLM, Llama-Maverick, Kimi, …). |
| `base_url`         | string | **req**                                                      | The full endpoint URL; for Azure include `?api-version=...`. |
| `api_key_env`      | string | **req**                                                      | Name of the env var holding the API key. The runner reads `os.environ[api_key_env]`. |
| `deployment_name`  | string | falls back to `name`                                         | If your Azure deployment name differs from the display name, put the deployment name here. |
| `reasoning_effort` | string | inherits `[agent].reasoning_effort`                          | Per-model override. Only meaningful for `api_kind = "openai"`. |
| `omit_responses_reasoning` | bool | `false` | If `true`, omit the `reasoning` field on `responses.create`. Occasionally useful for strict Responses gateways; **not used for Grok** (use `openai_chat` instead). |
| `omit_chat_run_meta` | bool | `false` | If `true`, omit `popcornbench_run_meta` from Chat Completions `extra_body`. Use for strict Azure Foundry chat gateways that reject unknown request keys (e.g. **FW-GLM-5-1**). |
| `request_timeout_s` | float | SDK default | HTTP timeout (seconds) for the OpenAI client. Use a large value (e.g. `3600`) for slow Grok / reasoning models. |
| `rpm`              | int    | `250`                                                        | Requests-per-minute budget for this model. Currently informational; concurrency is capped via `tpm` (see below). |
| `tpm`              | int    | `250000`                                                     | Tokens-per-minute budget. Default per-model concurrency is `tpm / 25_000` (≈10k tokens/turn × 2.5× safety). |
| `max_concurrency`  | int    | derived from `tpm`                                           | Hard cap on in-flight LLM calls for this model. Override once you've measured real token usage per turn. |

### Putting it together: sweep matrix

```
work_items = (variants × levels × problem_subset × models)
process pool size = parallelism.num_gpu_devices × parallelism.agents_per_gpu
per-model concurrency cap = max_concurrency or floor(tpm / 25_000)
per-GPU perf-timing lock   = parallelism.perf_lock_per_gpu
```

Each work item lives in its own JSON trajectory file under
`runs/{name}/{variant}/{model}/level_{L}_problem_{P}_trajectory.json`. If that
file already exists when the runner starts, the work item is skipped — so
re-running the same TOML resumes a partial sweep.

## Probing endpoints before a real sweep

Before a long run, sanity-check that every key + URL combination still works:

```bash
uv run python scripts/probe_endpoints.py
# xAI Grok only (needs XAI_API_KEY; optional XAI_MODEL):
# uv run python scripts/probe_endpoints.py --xai-only
# OK    gpt-5.4-pro                             openai       pong
# OK    gpt-5.5                                 openai       pong
# OK    FW-GLM-5-1                              openai_chat  Pong!
# OK    Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8  openai_chat  Pong!
# OK    Kimi-K2.6                               openai_chat  <no text>
# 5/5 endpoints reachable
```

Each probe sends a one-token "ping" through the same OpenAI SDK code path the
sweep uses, so a 200 here means the sweep can talk to that model.

## Generating the report manually

If a sweep is already done (or you're inspecting a paused run):

```bash
uv run python scripts/build_report.py runs/sweep_demo
# → writes runs/sweep_demo/report/index.html
```
